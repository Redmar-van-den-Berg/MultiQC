Description: >
    pbmarkdup takes one or multiple sequencing chips of an amplified libray as
    HiFi reads and marks or removes duplicates.

The pbmarkdup module parses results generated by
[pbmarkdup](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbmarkdup), and adds the
**% Unique Molecules** and **%Duplicate Reads** to the General Statistics
table.

This module assumes that pbmarkdup has been run for every sample, and that
the pbmarkup log file is named `sample.pbmarkdup.log`.
